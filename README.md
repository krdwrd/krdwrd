# KrdWrd

The KrdWrd Project is finished. It had its peak between 2008 and 2010.  The
mission statement was to 
> Provide tools and infrastructure for acquisition, visual annotation, merging and storage of web pages as parts of bigger corpora.'
>
> Develop a classification engine that learns to automatically annotate pages, provide visual tools for inspection of results.

For people who wanted to tag Web pages, there was a Firefox AddOn for tagging data. The annotation guidelines and the Add-on manual [are still available](/manual).
